# cloudf
KU EECS 448, Software Engineering I. Project III.

Cloudf is a cloud storage system built using Node. It uses MongoDB for actual file storage.

User accounts and authentication are supported using MySQL.

The project supports most functions that would be expected of an online storage system:

  * File & Directory Upload
  * File & Directory Download
  * Directory creation
  * Renaming items
  * Moving items using click & drag
  * Sharing items with other Cloudf users

Cloudf is set up to use Docker for simpler deployment.
